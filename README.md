# simon-game
Simon game from Dr Angela Yu Web Development Course.

This challenge required the creation of a game with four buttons, the main goal is for the user to repeat a given pattern of button clicks.
Each level one button will flash, the user needs to click all buttons from previous levels along with the new flashing button at the end.

Created a little twist on this challenge and made it so that each level, a new pattern is displayed, with an additional button each level.
